Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Cleaned and Averaged Data Set


The original experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

The tidy data set contains the volunteer and their activity grouped averaged mean and standard deviation from the original measurements.

The original data set and its description can be downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'Codebook.txt'

- 'cleanfullUCIHAR.txt' each row is a persons activity containing the mean and standard deviations from the original measurements

- 'tidyMeanUCIHAR.txt' contains the volunteer and their activity grouped averaged mean and standard deviation from the original measurements

Study Design
============

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. The Inertial Signals subdirectory is not necessary for our analyis from the original project.
The new table names will be STH if the originals were STH_test.txt and STH_train.txt. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Filter the original features.txt and apply it to the X tables to extract the columns. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, the activity names and the persons/volunteers (from the subject files) are added as a column to the filtered measurements.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Code book
=========

1. 'cleanfullUCIHAR.txt' each row is a persons activity containing the mean and standard deviations from the original measurements
The columns: 
- Person the id of the volunteer numeric value between 1 and 30
- Activity string from the list of the 6 possible activities
- Mean and standard deviation features 79 columns, the values are normalised, so numeric values between -1 and 1. 


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals and extracted from the original data are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

Example feature names used as the column names based on the above description: "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "tBodyAcc-std()-X" "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean()-X"


2. 'tidyMeanUCIHAR.txt' contains the volunteer and their activity grouped averaged mean and standard deviation from the original measurements
it has the same set of columns and value types as the 'cleanfullUCIHAR.txt', just with much less rows due to the grouping.

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
